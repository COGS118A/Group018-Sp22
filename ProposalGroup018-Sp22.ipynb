    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "This project has the goal of using machine learning algorithm methods, like regression models, to predict a soccer player's future contract by using their performance statistics, age, position, future potential, background, current team, agent, remaining years in current contract and marketing potential as the data. The contract variables that this project will predict are the player's transfer market value, annual salary, release clause, and potential bonuses. We will take the data and utilize regression models and data visualization in order to analyze and show the relationships between the different variables. We will be able to check for performance by comparing the predictions to actual contracts on similar players, as we would predict for the new contract to be similar to the mean of the others."

    "In order to have a good understanding of how algorithms have been used to predict a football player market value, we researched how others have achieved this and what they used to make such predictions. Creating the most objective machine learning algorithm possible is very importnat since day by day, metrics and data become more and more important when it comes to the invesinting of money in different sectors, including fottball. An organization that has been using a strong algorithm to make player's market value predictions is the Football Observatory, also known as the CIES, which is a site that since 2013 has developed an econometric technique to calculate any player's transfer value using the player's objective performancence (CIES Footaball Index), which takes the following into consideration: ability to minimize goal opportunities through one-to-one duelling, ability to minimize goal opportunities through ball interception, percentage of accurate passes, percentage of successfull dribbles, ability to set teammates in favorable goal positions (assists) and percentage of shots on target.<a name=\"CIES Football Observatory\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#CIESnote)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our research for prior work, we came upon a very detailed project that aimed at predicting a player's future performance based on past performances. One of the primary goals of the algorithm designed by the creators of this project was to remove human bias from the predictions as much as possible and create objective inferences. They created a supervised machine learning algorithm following these steps: loading and cleaning data, definining a target variable, deciding which model to use, in this case a tree based model, choosing what data visualizations to use, and analyze them to ajust our model to make the most accurate predictions. Although the goal of this project was to predict future performance and the goal of our project is to predict market value, we thought it would be a great idea to use this project as a template in terms of what steps we should follow to arrive to our conclusions in the most optimal way. Also, since performance tends to be very closely associated with market value, our model would be very similar to the one being used in this project.<a name=\"Towards Data Science\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#TowardsDataSciencenote)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand the principles of football player's transfer market contrats, we proceeded to investiage more about transfer principles since there are many variables that come into play when prediciting the final market value in a buying contract. This article exaplains what a transfer is, which put in simple terms, is when a player's registration details switch from one football association to another. The transfer fee is the amount of money that the buying side has to pay for since the selling party will not have access to the player's services and they need compensation for it. This compensation can be both in the form of solely monetary value or a combination of money and a player in exchange. \"Add ons\" can also play a role in the final value of the transfer fee since it's money that the buying team can pay in addition to the transfer fee, which is payed for depending on certain goals that the buying team sets for the player.<a name=\"Transfer Fee\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#TransferFeenote)"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict the financial value of a soccer player in the transfer market. We do this by taking into account the features/information of the player and quantifying them as our metrics (for more details, see Evaluation Metrics section below). We are planning on 1. utilizing regression with a certain amount of metrics to then find the relationship and predict the financial value of a player’s contract and/or 2. using decision trees to possibly classify the players financially in groups."

    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned in the Problem Statement, we plan on 1. utilizing regression with a certain amount of metrics to then find the relationship and predict the financial value of a player’s contract and/or 2. using decision trees to possibly classify the players financially in groups. An example of a relationship could be determining the player’s worth depending on age, amount of goals, and nationality. We can then use data visualization and regression to show these relationships. The solution will be tested by comparing our predictions to player values and contracts of past years, as we will be predicting those years. In other words, both our training set and our testing set will be based off of past years."

    "For our data which is based strictly on game statistics and performances for individual players and their team, there are no privacy concerns as this data is made public, usually in real-time while the events are happening. This public data can be found on multiple websites which are free to access. To ensure a minimal amount of bias when working with this data, we can cross-reference game statistics across multiple sport websites to ensure accuracy and fairness. For our data which isn’t public, like from StatsBomb, there still isn’t any privacy issues since they simply analyze data which is already publicly available. As discussed, there are no privacy concerns with the data that has been implemented. However, we do have potential biases. The analyzed data that we’ll use from StatsBomb, could introduce a source of bias since their analysis methods may not be completely transparent on which variables they use or if they choose some factors to have more weight than others. Using multiple sources and points of view will allow us to potentially avoid as much bias as possible. Another bias to note is that we are selecting players from popular and wealthier leagues to do further analyses based on our predisposed beliefs that they would show stronger correlations. However, we can address this bias by sampling from random smaller division leagues in different countries in our analysis. Another bias problem is that major economic events may have an effect on our data, causing our results to possibly be skewed.\n"
